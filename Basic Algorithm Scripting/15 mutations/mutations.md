Return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array.

For example, `["hello", "Hello"]`, should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case.

The arguments `["hello", "hey"]` should return false because the string "hello" does not contain a "y".

Lastly, ["Alien", "line"], should return true because all of the letters in "line" are present in "Alien".
