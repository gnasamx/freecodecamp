Another huge advantage of the _spread operator_, is the ability to combine arrays, or to insert all the elements of one array into another, at any index. With more traditional syntaxes, we can concatenate arrays, but this only allows us to combine arrays at the end of one, and at the start of another. Spread syntax makes the following operation extremely simple:

```js
let thisArray = ["sage", "rosemary", "parsley", "thyme"];

let thatArray = ["basil", "cilantro", ...thisArray, "coriander"];
// thatArray now equals ['basil', 'cilantro', 'sage', 'rosemary', 'parsley', 'thyme', 'coriander']
```

Using spread syntax, we have just achieved an operation that would have been more complex and more verbose had we used traditional methods.

:fire:

We have defined a function `spreadOut` that returns the variable sentence, modify the function using the _spread operator_ so that it returns the array `['learning', 'to', 'code', 'is', 'fun']`.
