When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of `undefined`. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be `NaN` which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of "undefined".

Initialize the three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` with `5`, `10`, and `"I am a"` respectively so that they will not be `undefined`.
