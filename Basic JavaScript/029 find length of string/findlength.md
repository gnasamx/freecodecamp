You can find the length of a `String` value by writing `.length` after the string variable or string literal.

```javascript
"Alan Peter".length; // 10
```

For example, if we created a variable `var firstName = "Charles"`, we could find out how long the string `"Charles"` is by using the `firstName.length` property.

Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.
