You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.

For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter of the `var firstName = "Charles"` string by using `firstName[firstName.length - 3]`

:fire:

Use _bracket notation_ to find the second-to-last character in the `lastName` string.

Hint
Try looking at the `thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName` variable declaration if you get stuck.
