Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are _mutable_ and can be changed freely.

Example

```javascript
var ourArray = [50, 40, 30];
ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]
```

Note

There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0]. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

:fire:

Modify the data stored at index `0` of `myArray` to a value of `45`s.
