The inequality operator (`!=`) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means `"Not Equal"` and returns `false` where equality would return true and vice versa. :star: Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

```javascript
1 != 2; // true
1 != "1"; // false
1 != "1"; // false
1 != true; // false
0 != false; // false
```

:fire:

Add the inequality operator `!=` in the `if` statement so that the function will return `"Not Equal"` when `val` is not equivalent to `99`.
