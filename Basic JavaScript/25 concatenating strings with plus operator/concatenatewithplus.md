In JavaScript, when the `+` operator is used with a `String` value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by _concatenating_ them together.

Example

```javascript
"My name is Alan," + " I concatenate.";
```

Note

Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Build `myStr` from the strings `"This is the start. "` and `"This is the end."` using the `+` operator.
