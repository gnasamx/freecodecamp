We can also use the `+=` operator to _concatenate_ a string onto the end of an existing string variable. This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

Note
Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Build `myStr` over several lines by concatenating these two strings: `"This is the first sentence. "` and `"This is the second sentence."` using the `+=` operator. Use the `+=` operator similar to how it is shown in the editor. Start by assigning the first string to `myStr`, then add on the second string.
