Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (`+`), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

:fire:

Set `myName` to a string equal to your name and build `myStr` with `myName` between the strings `"My name is "` and `" and I am well!"`
