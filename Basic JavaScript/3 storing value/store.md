In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.
```javascript
myVariable = 5;
```
This assigns the Number value 5 to myVariable.

Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the = operator is resolved before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.

```javascript
myVar = 5;
myNum = myVar;
```
This assigns 5 to myVar and then resolves myVar to 5 again and assigns it to myNum.

Assign the value 7 to variable a.

Assign the contents of a to variable b.
