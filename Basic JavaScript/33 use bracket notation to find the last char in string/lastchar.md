In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if `var firstName = "Charles"`, you can get the value of the last letter of the string by using `firstName[firstName.length - 1]`.

Use _bracket notation_ to find the last character in the `lastName` variable.

Hint
Try looking at the `lastLetterOfFirstName` variable declaration if you get stuck.
