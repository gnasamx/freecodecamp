With JavaScript `array` variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

```javascript
var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].
```

Modify the new array `myArray` so that it contains both a string and a number (in that order).

Hint
Refer to the example code in the text editor if you get stuck.
