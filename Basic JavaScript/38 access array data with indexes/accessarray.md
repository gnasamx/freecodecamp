We can access the data inside arrays using _indexes_.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array is element 0.

Example

```javascript
var array = [50, 60, 70];
array[0]; // equals 50
var data = array[1]; // equals 60
```

Note
There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like `array [0]`. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

:fire:

Create a variable called `myData` and set it to equal the first value of `myArray` using bracket notation.
