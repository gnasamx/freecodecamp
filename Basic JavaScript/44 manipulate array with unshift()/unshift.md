Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.

.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, :zap: unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.

:fire:

Add `["Paul",35]` to the beginning of the `myArray` variable using `unshift()`.
