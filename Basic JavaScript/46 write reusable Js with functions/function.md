In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.

Here's an example of a function:

```javascript
function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```

You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this:

`functionName();`

Each time the function is called it will print out the message `"Hello World"` on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

:fire:

Create a function called `reusableFunction` which prints "Hi World" to the dev console.
Call the function.
