Another data type is the _Boolean_. `Booleans` may only be one of two values: `true` or `false`. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off." These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note

`Boolean` values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

Modify the `welcomeToBooleans` function so that it returns `true` instead of `false` when the run button is clicked.
