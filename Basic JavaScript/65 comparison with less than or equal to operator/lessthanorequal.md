The less than or equal to operator (`<=`) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns `true`. If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns `false`. Like the equality operator, less than or equal to converts data types.

Examples

```javascript
4 <= 5; // true
"7" <= 7; // true
5 <= 5; // true
3 <= 2; // false
"8" <= 4; // false
```

Add the `less than or equal to` operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.
