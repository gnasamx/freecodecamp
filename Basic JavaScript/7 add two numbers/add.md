`Number` is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the `+` symbol as addition operation when placed between two numbers.

Example

```javascript
myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15
```

:fire:

Change the `0` so that `sum` will equal `20`.
