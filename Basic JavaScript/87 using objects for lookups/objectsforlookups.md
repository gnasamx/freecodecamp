Objects can be thought of as a _key/value_ storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to "lookup" values rather than a `switch` statement or an `if/else` chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:

```javascript
var alpha = {
  1:"Z",
  2:"Y",
  3:"X",
  4:"W",
  ...
  24:"C",
  25:"B",
  26:"A"
};
alpha[2]; // "Y"
alpha[24]; // "C"

var value = 2;
alpha[value]; // "Y"
```

Convert the switch statement into an object called `lookup`. Use it to look up `val` and assign the associated string to the `result` variable.
