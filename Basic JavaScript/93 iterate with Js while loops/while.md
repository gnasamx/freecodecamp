You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The first type of loop we will learn is called a `"while"` loop because it runs "while" a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

```javascript
var ourArray = [];
var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
```

Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

:fire:

Push the numbers 0 through 4 to `myArray` using a `while` loop.
