It would teach us a lot about the `filter` method if we try to implement a version of it that behaves exactly like `Array.prototype.filter()`. It can use either a `for` loop or `Array.prototype.forEach()`.

Note: A pure function is allowed to alter local variables defined within its scope, although, it's preferable to avoid that as well.

Write your own `Array.prototype.myFilter()`, which should behave exactly like `Array.prototype.filter()`. You may use a `for` loop or the `Array.prototype.forEach()` method.
