Fill in the object constructor with the following methods below:

getFirstName() getLastName() getFullName() setFirstName(first) setLastName(last) setFullName(firstAndLast)
Run the tests to see the expected output for each method.

The methods that take an argument must accept only one argument and it has to be a string.

These methods must be the only available means of interacting with the object.
