The last challenge created an `object` with various properties, now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:

```js
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
// This prints "Aflac" to the console
```

Dot notation is used on the `object` name, `duck`, followed by the name of the `property`, `name`, to access the value of "Aflac".

:fire:

Print both `properties` of the `dog` object below to your console.
