You've learned that you can use a shortcut to match alphanumerics `[A-Za-z0-9_]` using `\w`. A natural pattern you might want to search for is the opposite of alphanumerics.

You can search for the opposite of the `\w` with `\W`. Note, the opposite pattern uses a capital letter. This shortcut is the same as `[^A-Za-z0-9_]`.

```js
let shortHand = /\W/;
let numbers = "42%";
let sentence = "Coding!";
numbers.match(shortHand); // Returns ["%"]
sentence.match(shortHand); // Returns ["!"]
```

:fire:

Use the shorthand character class `\W` to count the number of non-alphanumeric characters in various quotes and strings.
