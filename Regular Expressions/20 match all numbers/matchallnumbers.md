You've learned shortcuts for common string patterns like alphanumerics. Another common pattern is looking for just digits or numbers.

The shortcut to look for digit characters is `\d`, with a lowercase `d`. This is equal to the character class `[0-9]`, which looks for a single character of any number between zero and nine.

Use the shorthand character class `\d` to count how many digits are in movie titles. Written out numbers ("six" instead of 6) do not count.
