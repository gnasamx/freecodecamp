Sometimes whitespace characters around strings are not wanted but are there. Typical processing of strings is to remove the whitespace at the start and end of it.

Write a regex and use the appropriate string methods to remove whitespace at the beginning and end of strings.

Note
The `.trim()` method would work here, but you'll need to complete this challenge using regular expressions.
